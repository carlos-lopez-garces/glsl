This repository is the result of studying:

* OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook, by David Wolff
* Alan Wolfe's [blog](https://blog.demofox.org)

1 Shading models ([notes/1 Shading Models](notes/Shading_Models.pdf))

* Diffuse and per-vertex shading with a single point light source, omnidirectional scattering
* Gooch model, variation
* Phong reflection model, per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular Gouraud shading
* Gouraud vertex interpolation shading vs Flat shading

2 Textures and maps ([notes/2 Textures and Maps](notes/Textures_and_Maps.pdf))

* Diffuse textures
* Textures and shading models
* Multiple textures
* Alpha
* Normal maps
* Environment cube maps and skyboxes; refraction
* Image-based lighting, irradiance environment maps
* Rendering to a texture

3 Real-time path tracing ([Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WscyWr))

* Basic camera, diffuse, emissive
* Glossy reflections
* Fresnel, rough refraction and absorption; orbit camera
