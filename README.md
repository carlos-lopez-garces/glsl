* Diffuse and per-vertex shading with a single point light source, omnidirectional scattering
* Gooch model, variation
* Phong reflection model, per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular Gouraud shading
* Gouraud vertex interpolation shading vs Flat shading

2 Textures and maps ([notes/1 Shading Models](notes/Textures_and_Maps.pdf))

* Diffuse textures

* Multiple textures
* Alpha
* Normal maps
* Environment cube maps and skyboxes; refraction
